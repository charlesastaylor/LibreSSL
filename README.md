Jai bindings to [LibreSSL](https://github.com/libressl/portable). Current version is LibreSSL v4.0.0. Last tested with jai version beta 0.2.010.

Binaries are provided for Windows, Linux and Android. Macos should be easy enough to get working with some tweaks to `generate.jai`. Compiled programs will statically link, shared libraries are provided for compile time execution (on desktop platforms).
